#  Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

This project focuses on building a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System using machine learning techniques. Have you ever wondered how platforms like Google suggest movies that are similar to the ones you enjoy? By going through this post, you will be equipped to create your own personalized recommendation system.

## Types of Recommendation Engines
There are primarily three types of recommendation engines:

1. **Popularity-Based Recommendation Engine**: This straightforward algorithm powers the trending lists on platforms like YouTube or Netflix. It ranks movies based on their view counts, showcasing the most popular content first.

2. **Content-Based Recommendation Engine**: In this approach, the system analyzes the content of a movie (storyline, genre, cast, director, etc.) that a user likes and suggests similar movies based on these attributes. The recommendations are tailored to the user's preferences.

3. **Collaborative Filtering-Based Recommendation Engine**: By identifying similar users based on their activities and preferences, this algorithm recommends items that one user has experienced but the other hasn't. It leverages the collaboration between users to provide personalized recommendations.

## Features Added to the Content-Based Movie Recommendation System
In our implementation using the scikit-learn library, we have included the following features:

- movie_id: Unique identifier for each movie
- title: Title of the movie
- release_date: Date when the movie was released
- vote_count: Number of votes received by the movie
- vote_average: Average rating given to the movie
- popularity: Popularity score of the movie
- genres: Genre(s) associated with the movie
- year: Year of release of the movie
- wr: Weighted rating for each movie

By incorporating these features, our content-based recommendation system aims to provide accurate and relevant movie suggestions based on user preferences and content similarities. Dive into the world of personalized movie recommendations with our implementation!

## Calculating Similarity Scores:

When determining which item is most similar to the one a user likes, similarity scores play a crucial role in the decision-making process.

A similarity score is a numerical value that falls within the range of zero to one, aiding in assessing the degree of similarity between two items on a scale from zero to one. This score is derived by evaluating the resemblance between the textual details of both items, serving as a measure of similarity between the provided text details of two items. The calculation of this similarity score is often accomplished using cosine similarity.

## Understanding Cosine Similarity:

Cosine similarity serves as a metric for quantifying the similarity between documents regardless of their sizes. In mathematical terms, it gauges the cosine of the angle formed by two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. The utility of cosine similarity lies in its ability to indicate that even if two documents share similarities but are distanced apart in terms of Euclidean distance (due to document size), they may still align closely together in orientation. In essence, the smaller the angle between vectors, the higher the cosine similarity.
